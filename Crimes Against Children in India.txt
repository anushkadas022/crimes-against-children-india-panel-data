# Crimes Against Children in India (2001–2012)
## Panel Data Analysis of State-Level Trends

This repository contains my empirical research project analysing trends in reported crimes against children across 38 Indian states and union territories using panel data econometrics.

This project was completed as part of my M.A. Economics coursework at Fergusson College, Pune.

## 📌 Research Objective

The study investigates how reported crimes against children evolved between 2001 and 2012 and whether the observed increase reflects rising victimisation or improvements in crime reporting and legal awareness.

The research uses panel data techniques to separate:
• Cross-state differences  
• Within-state time trends

## 🧠 Methodology

The study applies econometric panel data models:

• Pooled OLS  
• Fixed Effects Model  
• Random Effects Model  
• Hausman Test  
• Robust Standard Errors  
• Robustness Checks  

Software used:
- R (plm package)

## 📈 Key Findings

• Reported crimes increased by ~590% between 2001–2012  
• Fixed effects improved model fit significantly (R²: 0.05 → 0.43)  
• 92% of variation in crime counts is explained by state-level heterogeneity  
• Evidence suggests the increase reflects **improved reporting infrastructure and legal reforms**, rather than proportional increases in victimisation.
