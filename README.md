# Crimes Against Children in India (2001–2012)
### Panel Data Econometric Analysis

This repository contains my empirical research project analysing trends in reported crimes against children across 38 Indian states and union territories using panel data econometrics.

This project was completed as part of my M.A. Economics coursework at Fergusson College, Pune.

## 📌 Research Question

Did reported crimes against children actually increase in India, or did improvements in reporting systems and legal reforms make crimes more visible?

The study uses panel data methods to separate:
- Cross-state differences
- Within-state time trends

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) – *Crime in India Reports*

**Coverage**
- 38 States & Union Territories  
- Time Period: 2001–2012  
- Balanced Panel: 456 state-year observations  

The dataset aggregates all categories of **crimes against children**.

## 🧠 Methodology

Econometric models used:

- Pooled OLS  
- Fixed Effects Model  
- Random Effects Model  
- Hausman Test  
- Robust Standard Errors  
- Robustness Checks  

**Software:** R (plm package)

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Reported crimes increased by **~590%** between 2001–2012  
- Fixed effects greatly improved model fit (**R²: 0.05 → 0.43**)  
- **92% of variation** explained by state-level heterogeneity  
- Evidence suggests the rise reflects **improved reporting, legal awareness and child-protection reforms**, rather than proportional increases in victimisation.
